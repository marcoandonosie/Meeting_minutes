Danantara AI Meeting Minutes Generator — System Overview
Objective


The system automates the creation of standardized Minutes of Meeting (MoM) documents from bilingual (English–Indonesian) meeting discussions. It streamlines the documentation process for internal use, audits, and BOD reviews by transcribing recordings, structuring information, and generating official MoM files in a consistent format.


Workflow Summary
The tool runs in three main stages — each modular and testable on its own:

1. Transcription (Input: Audio → Output: Text)

File: transcribe.py
Purpose: Converts spoken bilingual audio (English–Indonesian mix) into text.
How it works:

Takes an uploaded audio file (e.g. .mp3, .wav, .m4a)

Sends it to ElevenLabs’ Speech-to-Text API

Returns a plain-text transcript of the full conversation

Input: Raw audio file (meeting recording)
Output: Transcript text (as a Python string)

2. Parsing (Input: Transcript → Output: Structured JSON)

File: parser.py
Purpose: Uses GPT to extract key meeting details from the transcript into a clean, standardized structure.
How it works:

Sends the transcript to GPT with a custom prompt asking it to identify:

Date and time of meeting

Participants

Context or background

Key discussion points

Action items or next steps

GPT outputs a structured JSON object

Input: Transcript text
Output: JSON (structured meeting summary)

3. Document Generation (Input: JSON → Output: MoM Word File)

File: docgen.py
Purpose: Converts the structured GPT output into an official Word document formatted according to Danantara’s internal MoM template.
How it works:

Reads the JSON data

Auto-fills standard sections:

“Tanggal & Judul Rapat”

“Peserta Rapat”

“Konteks / Latar Belakang”

“Pokok Pembahasan”

“Tindak Lanjut / Langkah Berikutnya”

Exports as a .docx file

Input: JSON data
Output: Downloadable .docx file (final MoM)

Front-End Interface

File: app.py
Purpose: Provides a user-friendly interface built on Streamlit.
